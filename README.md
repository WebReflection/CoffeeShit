The CoffeeScript "code parody"
==============================

This silly project does not want to offend the CoffeeScript creator neither any CoffeeScript user

About
-----

Every cult movie has one or more parodies ... well, every cult technology as well (or at least it should)!

When I have first read about [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) I was extremely sceptic.
As a **pure JS developer** I could not stand in front of such "*mostruisity*" ... my favorite programming language denatured like that? *No fucking way!*

At that time I have been trying to understand why developers were so excited about it and I could not came out with a proper answer except: "*ooooh come on, all this fuss just for some sugar?* ... *I don't even like coffee with sugar!*"


Aim
---

**None**, except demonstrate how evil could be the *JavaScript* nature. This script was standing in some folder I forgot existed.
Today I have accidentally found again this funny code and since I was laughing by myself like an idiot I decided to let other developers have a lough too.
To see how it works, launch *testShit.html* file and check out the source code.

**Do not** use *CoffeeShit* in any production environment!
It's just a "*stupid monster*" that's imitating CofeeScript possibilities and mainly/only as shown in the example page.


Lesson
------

JavaScript may be fun and this is an example. *CoffeeScript* ? ... surely one of the most interesting projects JS related I know, together with [haxe](http://haxe.org/) ;-)
